### Explanation:

**CPU (Processor)**:
   - **Control Unit (CU)**: The control unit coordinates the activities of the CPU, fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, and executing them.
   - **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)**: The ALU performs all arithmetic and logical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, AND, OR).

**Memory**: 
   - In Von Neumann Architecture, memory is a **single shared space** where both program instructions and data reside. The CPU accesses this memory to fetch instructions or read/write data.

**Input/Output (I/O)**: 
   - The I/O devices interact with the system by sending data into memory (input) or reading from memory (output). These are the peripherals that connect the computer to the outside world (e.g., keyboard, screen, disk drives).

### Von Neumann Architecture Overview:

In the Von Neumann model, both **program instructions** and **data** are stored in the **same memory** and accessed via the same bus, which leads to a shared memory bottleneck (known as the "Von Neumann bottleneck"). This is in contrast to Harvard architecture, where separate memories exist for data and instructions.

This architecture is the foundation of most modern computing systems.

## Virtual Memory and Physical Memory

Below is an ASCII diagram showing the relationship between the **Linux Kernel**, **Virtual Memory**, **Physical Memory**, and **Swap Space**:

### Explanation of the Components:

1. **User Space**:
   - This is where user programs and applications run. They interact with the kernel through system calls, but they are isolated from directly accessing hardware or kernel resources.
   - Programs are executed in the **Virtual Memory** space, which is managed by the kernel.

2. **Kernel Space**:
   - The kernel space is where the core functions of the operating system reside, including memory management, process control, and hardware abstraction.
   - **Virtual Memory Management**: The kernel manages the virtual address space of the applications. The **Page Tables** map virtual addresses to physical addresses in memory. The **Memory Management Unit (MMU)** handles address translation between virtual memory and physical memory.
   - **Process Control**: The kernel also handles process scheduling, interrupts, and resource allocation.

3. **Virtual Memory**:
   - **Virtual memory** allows applications to use a large, contiguous address space, even if physical memory is fragmented. The virtual memory space is divided into pages.
   - The kernel manages the mapping of virtual memory addresses to **physical memory** addresses using **page tables**.

4. **Physical Memory (RAM)**:
   - This is the actual physical memory installed in the system. The operating system allocates portions of physical memory to programs as needed.
   - The kernel uses virtual memory mapping to ensure that programs do not directly access physical memory, ensuring isolation and security.

5. **Swap Space**:
   - **Swap** is a portion of disk space used when physical memory (RAM) is full. The kernel moves inactive pages from RAM to swap space to free up memory for active processes.
   - Swap is slower than RAM, so it is used as a backup to prevent the system from running out of memory. When RAM is free again, the kernel may move data back from swap to RAM.
   - **Swap Space** is often located on the disk, typically in a swap partition or a swap file.

### Flow and Relationship:

- The **kernel** manages the interaction between **user programs** and the systemâ€™s resources. When a user program needs more memory than is physically available, the kernel uses **virtual memory** to simulate additional memory, paging data between **physical RAM** and **swap**.
- The **virtual memory** allows programs to access more memory than the available **physical memory** by swapping data between RAM and disk-based **swap space**.

This architecture allows Linux to manage memory efficiently, provide isolation between programs, and use disk space to handle memory pressure.

## Different ways to check memory utilization

### top

Example `top` header:

```
top - 15:13:31 up  7:08,  2 users,  load average: 0,53, 0,60, 0,70
Tasks: 507 total,   1 running, 505 sleeping,   0 stopped,   1 zombie
%Cpu(s):  1,5 us,  0,7 sy,  1,6 ni, 95,8 id,  0,0 wa,  0,2 hi,  0,2 si,  0,0 st
MiB Mem :  31843,5 total,  12394,3 free,   8865,7 used,  12591,5 buff/cache
MiB Swap:   8192,0 total,   8192,0 free,      0,0 used.  22977,8 avail Mem
```

### free

```
]$ free -m
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           31843        8892       12367        1539       12586       22951
Swap:           8191           0        8191
```

Description from free(1):

```
DESCRIPTION
       **free**  displays  the  total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system, as well as the buffers and caches used by the kernel. The information is gathered by parsing /proc/meminfo. The displayed columns are:

       **total**  Total usable memory (MemTotal and SwapTotal in /proc/meminfo). This includes the physical and swap memory minus a few reserved bits and  kernel binary code.

       **used**   Used or unavailable memory (calculated as total - available)

       **free**   Unused memory (MemFree and SwapFree in /proc/meminfo)

       **shared** Memory used (mostly) by tmpfs (Shmem in /proc/meminfo)

       **buffers**
              Memory used by kernel buffers (Buffers in /proc/meminfo)

       **cache**  Memory used by the page cache and slabs (Cached and SReclaimable in /proc/meminfo)

       **buff/cache**
              Sum of buffers and cache

       **available**
              Estimation  of  how  much  memory is available for starting new applications, without swapping. Unlike the data provided by the cache or free fields, this field takes into account page cache and also that not all reclaimable memory slabs will be reclaimed due to items being in use (MemAvailable in /proc/meminfo, available on kernels 3.14, emulated on kernels 2.6.27+, otherwise the same as free)
